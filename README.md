# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of Analysis

At Pewlett Hackard, we are facing a potential problem with our workforce. Many of a most senior, most relied upon
workers may be retiring soon. In order to prevent a severe brain drain, we need to take action to retain knowledge and
expertise before we loose it.

## Results

* As can be seen from [retirement_titles](retirement_titles.csv), 13376 employees are entering the retirement window.
* We worked to track down the current titles of these employees ([shown here](unique_titles.csv)).
* Further study showed a [breakdown of different job titles](retiring_titles.csv).
* The data shows that some employees are [well suited to mentor](mentorship_eligibility.csv).

## Summary

Our study of employee data has identified a large number of employees that are eligible for an exit package. A much
smaller (1549) set of employees are eligible for a mentorship program. By taking this action we can assure that we have
the workforce to deliver our projects in the future.
